The build failed because Rollup could not resolve the import "groq-sdk" from "src/services/groqService.ts".

Solution
To resolve this issue:

Verify that the package "groq-sdk" is included in the dependencies or devDependencies section of the package.json.
If the package is present in package.json, you need to add it to the external configuration in your Vite configuration.

Example of adding the "groq-sdk" package to the build.rollupOptions.external in the vite.config.js file:

// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['groq-sdk'],
    },
  },
});
